# POKEMON EMERALD LATIN TRANSLATION

![](header.png)

This is a project to translate Pokemon Emerald into Latin. 
For now, only the translation files will be kept here. 
These are meant to be combined with the Emerald Decompilation Project (https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) and then compiled. 
The english base text that is translated is extracted from the Decompilation Project also.

## WORKFLOW
1. Download the Decompilation Project from https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald 
2. Use the extract_text script to extract all the text from the game (already done, see Text/)
3. Find all the sprites containing english text (to be implemented)
4. Add translations to the text, change sprites, and upload to repo
5. Replace text in Decompilation Project (make.sh!) and compile
